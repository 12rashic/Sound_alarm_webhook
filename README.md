<H1>Introduction to Sound alarm trigger webhook </H1>

This webhook is built in python that captures the trigger from any source(you can integrate this webhook with any source eg:grafana) and then the webhook notifies the particular endpoint.

The webhook has 2 different soundtracks for each endpoint. You can customize it according to the requirements.Also this setup has seperate index.html pages that are rendered on particular requests
